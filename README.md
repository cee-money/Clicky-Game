# clicky-game

This game was made using React.js

While keeping track of the user's score, the application renders different images to the screen, all of which listen for click events. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
